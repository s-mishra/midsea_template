# Track 1: Modelling 101

## Overview
Introduction to infectious disease modelling concepts and basic mathematical frameworks.

## Prerequisites
- basic R
- understanding of ODEs

## Course Content
This track is the introduction to mathematical modelling for those who are new to or have limited experience in the field. We will cover formulating modeling questions, the building of models, model parameterisation,  running models in R, modelling interventions and model communication. As well as covering the technical aspects we will focus on the use of these models in practice for real world questions.
