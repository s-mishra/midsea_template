# Track 2: Simulation

## Overview
Hands-on experience with simulation techniques and numerical methods.

## Prerequisites
- basic R
- understanding of ODEs

## Course Content
This track focuses on stochastic simulation models, allowing participants to study how randomness impacts on the dynamics of outbreaks. We will cover some fundamental ideas in stochastic processes, such as Poisson processes, and fundamental approaches to implement them through computer simulation. We will then cover stochastic compartmental models, and static and dynamic network models. Participants should have some experience in coding and have knowledge of compartmental models (like SIR style models).
