# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Wirichada Pan-Ngumâ€™s research mainly involves designing mathematical and economic models to answer questions related to disease transmission and policy decision. Her interest is around applying modelling to gain better understanding of transmission routes, epidemiological patterns and interactions between host, vector and environment, especially on neglected tropical diseases in the region (NTD in Southeast Asia).  In addition to her work at MORU, Wirichada is an Associate Professor in the Department of Tropical Hygiene, Faculty of Tropical Medicine at Mahidol University and teaches biostatistics and mathematical modelling. She is keen on training and capacity building activities to increase modelling workforce and strengthen modelling network in the region."
