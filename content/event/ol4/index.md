summary: Exploring Eco-Epidemiological Modelling of Hantavirus Spread and Epidemiological Modelling of COVID-19 Transmission
abstract: "This sharing session aims to provide insights into two distinct modelling projects that contribute to our understanding of infectious disease dynamics in animal and human populations. The first project examines the eco-epidemiological modelling, focusing on the spread of hantavirus within ecological systems. Hantaviruses are a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause varied disease syndromes. This modelling initiative integrates ecological factors, such as rodent ecological dynamics, environmental factors and epidemiological components to unravel the complex interactions driving hantavirus transmission.
The second part of the session explores the ongoing efforts in epidemiological modelling of COVID-19 transmission. Given the unprecedented global impact of the COVID-19, understanding and predicting the dynamics of transmission is crucial for effective public health responses. This modelling project incorporates different factors such as reinfection force and healthcare system capacity, to simulate the spread of the virus and evaluate the efficacy of control measures.
Overall, this session will highlight the commonalities and differences in the approaches employed for modelling diseases spread with distinct ecological and/or epidemiological characteristics. Furthermore, the discussion will explore how insights gained from these models may support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of the diseases effectively."
