summary: "Vaccine impact modelling: HPV, Strep A, and chikungunya"
abstract: Vaccine value can be assessed from multiple perspectives including health benefits, safety, economic impact, equity, acceptance, feasibility, antimicrobial resistance, and broader socio-economic benefits. As a case study of an existing vaccine, we will discuss the health, economic, and equity impact of HPV vaccination. As a case study of new vaccines in the pipeline, we will discuss the health and economic impact and broader socioeconomic benefits of potential Strep A vaccination. As a case study of a newly licensed vaccine, we will discuss the evidence gaps for chikungunya vaccine introduction and implementation.
