summary: Understanding long-term sequelae of infectious diseases
abstract: "Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients experience a wide range of post-acute complications. Here, I will outline methods to estimate the post-acute risk and burden of new incident autoimmune, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, thrombotic respiratory and neuropsychiatric complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of  post-acute risks and excess burdens over multiple health domains are described over periods of Delta and Omicron predominance. The impact of vaccination and severity status of acute-phase infection on subsequent post-acute complications will also be discussed.  These results will also be contrasted against the post-acute risks of dengue infection."
