# Track 5: Specialised topics

## Overview
Advanced topics in specific disease areas and modelling approaches.

## Prerequisites
- Have taken Modelling 101 or Simulations (or have some equivalent modelling experiences)

## Course Content
This track will explore how core modelling skills can be applied to specialised topics, including modelling within-host infection dynamics, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions like non-pharmaceutical measures and vaccines, and incorporating space into infectious disease outbreaks. The goal is to help participants bridge the gap between general modelling knowledge and practical, topic-specific applications.
