# Adding Tooltips for Track Information (2025-03-18 08:42:20)

_**User**_

edit the table to show tool tips for each track having abstract and preqs

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add tooltips to the track columns in the table to show abstracts and prerequisites. I'll first read the file to understand the current structure and then make the necessary changes.

Let me edit the file to add tooltips using HTML title attributes for each track. I'll also add some CSS to make the tooltips more readable.

I've made the following changes to add tooltips to the track columns:

1. Added CSS styles for tooltips that will:
   - Show a help cursor when hovering over track names
   - Display a nicely formatted tooltip with a dark background
   - Support line breaks and proper text wrapping
   - Position the tooltip above the track name

2. Added tooltips to both the column headers and the first occurrence of each track in the schedule with:
   - Track name
   - Abstract description
   - Prerequisites

3. Used HTML entities (`&#10;`) for line breaks in the tooltips to ensure proper formatting

The tooltips will appear when users hover over any track name in the table. Each tooltip includes:
- The track name
- A brief abstract of what the track covers
- The prerequisites needed for that track

Would you like me to add tooltips to the remaining track occurrences in the table as well? Currently, they only appear in the header and first occurrence of each track.

_**User**_

insted of hover can we have a link to each track and that page has the details with ability to go back

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create individual pages for each track and modify the table to link to these pages instead of using tooltips. First, I'll create the track detail pages, and then update the main schedule page.

Let me first create the track detail pages:
